  <h2>How can Open Data be used?</h2>

  <p class="undo-indent">Data has the most potential when it is stored in a publicly accessible, machine readable, and non-proprietary data format. Below, we illustrate just a few of the potential uses of open government data. In general, public data linked online can in the words of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, "increase accountability, contribute valuable information about the world, and to enable government, the country, and the world to function more efficiently".
